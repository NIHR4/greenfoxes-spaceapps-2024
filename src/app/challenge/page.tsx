                    <p>This challenge focuses on using a combination of satellite and model-based datasets to accurately map both human-caused and natural greenhouse 
                        gas emissions. By doing so, we aim to enhance our understanding of how these emissions contribute to global warming. For this challenge, We have 
                        chosen to explore Topic 1: Human-Caused Emissions.</p>
